Features
- Find a way to upload images directly from iOS
- Order pictures in the album view trying to mix different aspect ratios as much as possible. If possible do this when creating the album so that the end user rendering javascript remains fast

Chores
- Better space management in repo - Is there a way to reduce size of the repo by using less images with little compromise in functionality or quality?
- Delete pictures from old commits - Can we fully remove deleted images from the repo to reduce size?
